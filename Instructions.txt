Crown Ledger Solutions — Overview

What it is
Crown Ledger Solutions is a specialized dental bookkeeping firm founded by Mark Copeland. We focus exclusively on helping dental practices gain financial clarity through organized, accurate, and proactive bookkeeping.

Core Services

Monthly Bookkeeping

Payroll

Cleanup (catch-up bookkeeping)

Tax Prep Support

Tax Strategy

Dental Backend (full back-office support tailored to dental offices: production-to-deposit tie-outs, overhead tracking, vendor payments, etc.)

Value Proposition

Save dentists time (hours every month freed from bookkeeping stress).

Save dentists money (monitoring key benchmarks like supplies at 5–6% of collections, payroll under 28%, and tracking insurance cash received vs. just billed).

Deliver tax-ready books and support CPAs for smoother, stress-free filings.

Provide industry-specific insight into dental overhead and profitability, not just generic bookkeeping.

Audience-Building Position
Right now, Crown Ledger Solutions is not taking on new clients — instead, we’re focused on building a large base of dental professionals who follow our content.
We regularly share:

Free tips on running a leaner, more profitable practice

Articles and guides that break down complex financial topics in plain language

Downloadable resources (checklists, benchmarks, tax prep guides)

Blog content with practical advice dentists can apply immediately

Why It Matters

Most dentists want to focus on patients, not QuickBooks.

Poor bookkeeping creates stress, blinds spots, and even lost profits.

By giving away education and tools, we establish trust and authority — so when dentists are ready for help, Crown Ledger Solutions is the obvious partner.

Brand Tone

Professional but approachable

Value-first (education over sales)

Transparent — not trying to sell to everyone, but helping the dental community at large
